Data Processing and Storage Assignment Using Python

Setup instructions: 

1. If Python is not installed on your computer, download Python from their official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open the data.py file in an editor of choice.
3. Run the data.py file in a terminal by entering the folder where it is located, and run the command: python3 data.py.
4. Compare the results to the ones expected in the comments of the example included in the data.py file.
5. Comment out a statement in the data.py file that expects an error and save, to proceed on checking the rest of the statements.
6. Repeat steps 3 - 5 to continue checking the example.

Tips to make an official assignment:

1. Instead of raising exceptions, have the students print an error statement to prevent having to comment out and rerun multiple times to check if the errors work.
2. Have a function to print the contents of the working-transaction array and pre-transaction array to ensure all contents are as expected.
3. Have a choice of 3 languages to use (Python, Java, C++) for the graders to predict how to run the code better.
